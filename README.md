# NodeJS
Created by Vince Chang </br>

- Contains exercises for understanding NodeJS. Attended NodeSchool workshops both in San Diego and at NPM HQ in Oakland, CA. These workshops covered NodeJS basics such as how to use NPM and different modules. NodeTraining was a 2 day course that built ontop of my knowledge from previous workshops. The course ramped up to evntually having the capability of building the backend of a website that allows users to shop for differnt US license plates.
