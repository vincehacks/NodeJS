  NUMBER TO STRING (Exercise 8 of 19)
 *****************************************************************************

  Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string. In those instances
  you will use the .toString() method. Here's an example:

     var n = 256;
     n = n.toString();

  The challenge:

  Define a variable named n that references the number 128; Call the
  .toString() method on the n variable. Use console.log() to print the results
  of the .toString() method to the terminal.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

     javascripting verify number-to-string.js

  var n = 128;
  console.log(n.toString());
