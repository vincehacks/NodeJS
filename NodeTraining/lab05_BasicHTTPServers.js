 * Lab 5 - Basic HTTP Servers
 * 
 * Your mission #1: Install http-server globally with npm and start a server in
 * the static-content folder of our labs. Then go to localhost:8080 in your
 * browser to see the static content being served.
 *
 * Your mission #2: Create a new file http.js and use the http module to create
 * a basic server that runs on port 8000. The server should work as follows:
 * When /hello is accessed, it should return Hello Node.js Server!
 * When /data is accessed, it should return the contents of the file
 * data/plates.json
 * Any other URL should return Nothing to see here
 *
 * Hint: Use the fs module to read a file with Node.JS
