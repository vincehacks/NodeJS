 * Lab 4 - Debugging Node.JS with Google Chrome
 * 
 * In this lab, weâ€™re going to debug a simple app to see the contents of both
 * the process and global objects.
 * 
 * Your mission: Create a file env-global.js that will get a reference to both
 * process and global objects. Then use the Chrome dev tools to inspect the
 * contents of these objects.
 * 
 * Hint: You can add a breakpoint to your code with the following statement:
 * debugger;
