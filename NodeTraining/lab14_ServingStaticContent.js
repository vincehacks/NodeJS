 * Lab 14 - Serving Static Content
 * 
 * In this lab, we’re going to get rid of our static http-server and serve the
 * store’s HTML, Javascript and CSS directly from Express.
 * 
 * Your mission: Using the web server we wrote during lab #5, add the required
 * configuration to serve content from the lp-store-ui directory. 
 * Now we only have one server running on http://localhost:8000
 *
 * As a result, let’s disable CORS since it’s not needed anymore
 * 
 * Hint: Use the sample config provided a few slides earlier
