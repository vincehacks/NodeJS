 * Lab 2 - Getting Dependencies with NPM
 * 
 * In this lab, we’re going to write a simple Node.JS application that just
 * says “Hello Node” using a styling library called Chalk
 * 
 * Your mission: Install Chalk with npm and use it to display “Hello Node” in
 * blue color over a white background.
 * 
 * Create a file hello-chalk.js and write the following code in it: 
 * const chalk = require('chalk');
 * Then use the Chalk documentation to achieve the desired styling: 
 * https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk
