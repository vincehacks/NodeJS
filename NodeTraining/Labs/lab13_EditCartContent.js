 * Lab 13 - See and Edit Cart Contents
 * 
 * In this lab, weâ€™re going to create a server endpoint to render cart items.
 *
 * Your mission: Using the web server we wrote during lab #4, create a new
 * HTTP GET endpoint /cart that returns all cart items
 * Test your cart at http://localhost:8080/cart.html
 * Create a new HTTP DELETE endpoint /cart that takes an id as a parameter and
 * removes an item from the cart array
 * Now you can add, see and remove items from your cart!
