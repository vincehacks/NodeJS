 * Lab 1 - Hello Node
 * 
 * In this lab, we’re going to write a simple Node.JS application that just
 * says “Hello Node”
 * 
 * Your mission: In order to run Node on your machine, first install the
 * LTS version from: https://nodejs.org/en/
 * 
 * Create a file hello-node.js and write the following code in it:
 * console.log("Hello Node");
 * 
 * Then open a terminal in the folder where hello-node.js is located and
 * run: node hello-node.js
 *****************************************************************************/

console.log("Hello Node");
