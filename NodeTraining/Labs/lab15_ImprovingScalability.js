 * Lab 15 - Improving Scalability of our Restful Web Service
 * 
 * In this lab, weâ€™re going to refactor our cart routes into a specific
 * cart-routing.js file. Our data models cart and plates will also get moved to
 * a data-models.js file.
 *
 * Your mission: Using the web server we wrote during lab #6, create the files
 * mentioned above and move the appropriate pieces of code to each file. 
 * Then include those files in your main server config file
