  STRING LENGTH (Exercise 4 of 19)
 *****************************************************************************

  You will often need to know how many characters are in a string. For this
  you will use the .length property. Here's an example:

    var example = 'example string';
    example.length

  The challenge:

  Create a variable named example. Assign the string 'example string' to the
  variable example. Use console.log to print the length of the string to the
  terminal.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

  javascripting verify string-length.js
 ****************************************************************************/

  var example = 'example string';
  console.log(example.length);
