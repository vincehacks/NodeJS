  VARIABLES (Exercise 2 of 19)
 *****************************************************************************

  A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are
  declared using var followed by the variable's name.

  Here's an example:

    var example;

  The above variable is declared, but it isn't defined (it does not yet
  reference a specific value).

  Here's an example of defining a variable, making it reference a specific
  value:

     var example = 'some string';

  The challenge:

  Declare a variable named example. Make the variable example equal to the
  value 'some string'. Then use console.log() to print the example variable to
  the console.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

  javascripting verify variables.js
 ****************************************************************************/

  var example = "some string";
  console.log(example);
