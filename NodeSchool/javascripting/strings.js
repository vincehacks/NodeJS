  STRINGS (Exercise 3 of 19)
 *****************************************************************************

  A string is a sequence of characters. A character is, roughly speaking, a
  written symbol. Examples of characters are letters, numbers, punctuation
  marks, and spaces.

  String values are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.

     'this is a string'

     "this is also a string"

  The challenge:

  Create a variable named someString. Use console.log to print the variable
  someString to the terminal.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:
